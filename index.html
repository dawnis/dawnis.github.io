	<h2>SmartFit.ai</h2>
        <p>SmartFit is a consulting project that I worked on for PM Fellow Steve Xie in collaboration with AI Fellow Rohan Bhandari at Insight Data Science. 
	For this project, I created an image-based recommender system which provides suggestions for women's tops. It works by extracting image statistics such as the histogram of oriented gradients and color spectra from the HSV-converted image in addition to encoding the structure of the top in an autoencoder network <a href="SmartFit/Convolutional Autoencoder Model.html">(architecture here)</a>. The model was  <a href="SmartFit/Validation_of_Recommender_System.html">validated</a> using the labels associated with items in the training data, the DeepFashio dataset from CUHK Media Lab.</p>
	<h2>Using Neural Networks to Analyze Neural Circuits</h2>
	<p> One type of data encountered often in neuroscience are microscopy time series in which the flashing of cells (due to a genetically encoded calcium sensitive indicator protein) corresponds to the activity of individual neurons (see video below for an example). <a href="Convolutional_Network_Ca_Transients/Ca_Feature_Detection_3P_Ver3_reduce_max.html">Convolutional Neural Network to Detect Ca++ Transients in Whole Brain Imaging </a> is a project to see if convolutional layers within neural networks can learn patterns associated with neuronal firing in neural Ca++ recording data. </p>
        An example of brain imaging data:
